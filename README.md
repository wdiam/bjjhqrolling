# bjjhqrolling

A simple script that monitors the rolling deals on BJJHQ. I don't like checking my phone religiously, so this project sends me push notifications when a new deal is posted.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wdiam/bjjhqrolling.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. Run the monitor:
   ```bash
   python3 run.py
   ```
